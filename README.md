# ubiquitous-garbanzo

This is my first personal project - a single program that will save information about a person to a .csv file.

Although the project is simple in idea and execution, I learned the basics of C independently over the last 2 months to create this.

The program has multiple functions:

- Print a start menu that will present you with a list of choices, each key will correspond to a choice that is in turn its own function.

- Add info: name, town, state, phone number.
  - You may either import an existing .csv file or save the information to a new file.

- Delete an entry.

- Edit an entry.

- Print the contents of a file.
